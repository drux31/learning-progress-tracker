### Learning Progress Tracker (Java)
This project is a Java project from the learning path **Spring security for Java backend Developpers**. Its objectives are to help us practice several Java subjects, such as:
* loops and flow controls;
* functional decomposition;
* SOLID principles;
* use of collections (Maps and Lists) to sort and filter data;
* JUnit testing.

#### About the project
Online learning is gaining popularity. A good education platform can manage registrations, track learning progress, send notifications and newsletters to many users worldwide. It is a huge volume of work indeed. In this project, we build an application that keeps track of the registered users, their learning progress, and metrics. It will also provide detailed information about each user or any category of users and the overall statistics for the entire learning platform.

The project is divided in five stages, detailled in the following lines.

###### Stage 1 - No empty lines
In this stage, a command-line interface (CLI) was implemented, so that the user can enter different commands and receive the corresponding responses. The CLI had to be case-insensitive and keep responses informative for the user.

**Main objectives**:
1. Demonstrate that it is running by printing its title: Learning Progress Tracker.
1. Wait for the commands. In this stage, the only command the program should recognize is exit. Once a user enters it, the program should print Bye! and quit.
1. Detect if a user has entered a blank line and print No input in response.
1. Print Unknown command! if a user enters an unknown command.
